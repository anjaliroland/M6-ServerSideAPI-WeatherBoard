# M6-ServerSideAPI-WeatherBoard

## Description

For this weeks challenge we were tasked with using server-side APIs along with everything else we have learned the past few weeks to create a weather dashboard that meets the following acceptance criteria:
<ul>
<li> When the user searches for a city they are presented with current and future conditions for that city, along with the city being added to the search history.
<li> The user is presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the wind speed.
<li> When viewing the future weather conditions for a city the user is presented with a five-day forecast which displays the date, and icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity.
<li> If the user clicks on a city from the search history they will again be presented with the current and future conditions for that city.
